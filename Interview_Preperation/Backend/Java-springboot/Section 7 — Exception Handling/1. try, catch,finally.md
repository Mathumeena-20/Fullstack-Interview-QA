# **1. What is the purpose of try, catch, and finally blocks?**

### ✔ `try`

Contains code that might throw an exception.

### ✔ `catch`

Handles the exception thrown from `try`.

### ✔ `finally`

Runs cleanup code regardless of whether exception occurred or not.

### Example:

```java
try {
    int x = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Divide by zero!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleanup done.");
}
```

---

# **2. Can you have multiple catch blocks for a single try?**

✔ YES.

Each catch should handle a different exception type.

```java
try {
    int[] arr = new int[2];
    arr[5] = 10;
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    System.out.println("Array error");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("General exception");
}
```

Rules:

* More specific catch blocks must come before general ones.

---

# **3. What happens if an exception is thrown but not caught?**

* JVM searches for a matching catch block in the call stack
* If none found →
  ❌ Program terminates
  ❌ Stack trace printed

Example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 1 / 0;  // no catch ⇒ JVM terminates program
}
```

---

# **4. Will finally always execute? Are there any exceptions?**

**Almost always**, but NOT in cases below:

### ❌ Exceptions where finally does NOT execute:

1. `System.exit(0)` is called
2. JVM crashes (OutOfMemory, fatal error)
3. Power failure / OS kill
4. If finally block runs into infinite loop

Example:

```java
try {
    System.exit(0);  // finally will NOT execute
} finally {
    System.out.println("Won't run");
}
```

---

# **5. What happens if an exception occurs in finally block?**

It **overrides** the exception from the try block.

Example:

```java
try {
    int x = 10 / 0;
} finally {
    int y = 10 / 0; // this exception hides the original one
}
```

Only the `finally` exception is thrown.

---

# **6. Can we have a try block without a catch?**

✔ YES — IF `finally` exists.

```java
try {
    System.out.println("try");
} finally {
    System.out.println("always");
}
```

✔ Valid
❌ try without catch and without finally is **invalid**.

---

# **7. Can we nest try-catch blocks?**

✔ Yes, allowed.

```java
try {
    try {
        int x = 10 / 0;
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
        System.out.println("Inner catch");
    }
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("Outer catch");
}
```

Used when:

* Different levels of handling needed
* Resource-specific handling

# **8. Difference between throw and throws**

| Feature     | `throw`                   | `throws`                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Meaning     | Manually throw exception  | Declares that method might throw exception |
| Used inside | Method body               | Method signature                           |
| Syntax      | `throw new Exception();`  | `void m() throws Exception`                |
| Throws      | Single exception instance | One or more exception types                |
| Purpose     | To create error           | To inform caller                           |

### Example:

```java
void validate(int age) throws Exception {
    if (age < 18)
        throw new Exception("Not adult");
}
```

---

# **9. What is exception propagation in Java?**

Exception moves **up the call stack** until caught.

### Example:

```java
void a() { b(); }
void b() { c(); }
void c() { int x = 10/0; }
```

Flow:

```
c() throws → b() throws → a() throws → main() → JVM
```

If none catches → program ends.

Only **unchecked exceptions** propagate automatically.
Checked exceptions must be handled or declared using `throws`.

---

# **10. What happens if both try and finally blocks return a value?**

The **finally return overrides the try return**.

Example:

```java
public static int test() {
    try {
        return 1;
    } finally {
        return 2;
    }
}

System.out.println(test()); // output → 2
```

**Important rule:**
✔ finally ALWAYS has higher priority than try/ catch return.

---

# ⭐ Full Example (covers most concepts)

```java
public static int calculate() {
    try {
        int x = 10 / 2;
        return x;                 // try return
    } catch (Exception e) {
        return -1;                // catch return
    } finally {
        System.out.println("Cleanup");
        // return 100;            // uncomment → overrides try & catch return
    }
}
```
