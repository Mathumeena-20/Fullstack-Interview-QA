# ✅ **1. What happens if two elements use the same `id`?**

### ✔ `id` must be **unique** in the entire HTML document.

If two elements share the same id:

---

### **What happens?**

1. **Invalid HTML** (fails W3C validation)
2. **JavaScript issues**

   * `document.getElementById()` returns **only the first matching element**
3. **CSS selector conflicts**

   * `#idName` applies to **both elements** (unexpected styling)
4. **Accessibility issues**

   * Screen readers may target the wrong label
5. **Browser behavior becomes unpredictable**

---

### ❌ Wrong:

```html
<div id="box"></div>
<div id="box"></div> <!-- same id -->
```

### ✔ Correct:

```html
<div id="box1"></div>
<div id="box2"></div>
```

---

### ✔ Interview summary:

> IDs must be unique; otherwise, JS, CSS, and accessibility break.

---

# ✅ **2. Can a `<div>` be inside a `<span>`? Why or why not?**

Short answer: **NO (invalid HTML).**

---

### Why?

* `<span>` is an **inline element**
* Inline elements **cannot contain block-level elements** like `<div>`

---

### ❌ Invalid:

```html
<span>
  <div>Not allowed</div>
</span>
```

### ✔ Valid:

```html
<div>
  <span>Allowed</span>
</div>
```

---

### Browser behavior:

Most browsers **auto-correct** and move the `<div>` *outside* the `<span>` during DOM creation.

---

### ✔ Interview summary:

> Inline elements like `<span>` cannot wrap block elements like `<div>`, because it breaks the HTML content model.

---

# ✅ **3. Why is `<b>` different from `<strong>`?**

Both make text **bold**, but they have different meanings:

---

## **<b> = purely visual styling**

* No semantic meaning
* Screen readers treat it as **normal text**

Example:

```html
<b>Bold Text</b>
```

---

## **<strong> = semantic importance**

* Conveys **importance / urgency**
* Screen readers emphasize it (stronger voice)

Example:

```html
<strong>Error!</strong> Please try again.
```

---

### ✔ Interview summary:

> `<b>` = stylistic only
> `<strong>` = semantic emphasis (important for accessibility + SEO)

---

# ✅ **4. Difference between HTML entity `&nbsp;` and space**

## ✔ Regular space:

* Collapses into a single space
* Multiple spaces turn into one
* Breakable (browser can wrap text around it)

Example:

```html
Hello     World
```

Rendered: **Hello World**

---

## ✔ `&nbsp;` (non-breaking space):

* Does **not collapse**
* Prevents line break
* Useful for:

  * Keeping words together
  * Aligning content
  * Preventing wrap in UI labels

### Example:

```html
Hello&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;World
```

Rendered: **Hello   World**

### Example (non-breaking):

```html
Price:&nbsp;$100
```

---

### ✔ Interview summary:

> Space collapses and is breakable;
> `&nbsp;` does not collapse and prevents line wrapping.

---

# ✅ **5. Are HTML tags case-sensitive? Why?**

### **NO — HTML tags are NOT case-sensitive.**

Meaning:

```html
<DIV> = <div> = <Div> = <dIv>
```

---

### Why?

* HTML is based on **SGML** (not case-sensitive)
* Browsers convert tags to **lowercase internally**
* HTML5 specification defines tags in lowercase

---

### Example:

```html
<DIV>Content</DIV>
```

Browser treats it exactly the same as:

```html
<div>Content</div>
```

---

### Exception:

➡ **XHTML is case-sensitive**, because it is XML-based.

---


> HTML tags are not case-sensitive because HTML is not XML. However, lowercase is recommended for consistency and readability.
