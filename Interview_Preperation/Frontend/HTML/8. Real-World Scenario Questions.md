# ✅ **1. If images are not loading, what are the possible reasons?**

There are several common causes:

---

## ✔ 1. Incorrect file path

Example:

```html
<img src="img/pic.png">
```

But actual location is:
`images/pic.png`

---

## ✔ 2. Wrong file name or extension

Case-sensitive on many servers.

---

## ✔ 3. File does not exist on server

Upload may be missing.

---

## ✔ 4. Image type not supported by browser

Old browsers may not support WebP/AVIF.

---

## ✔ 5. Missing `alt` or broken network

When network fails, browser may fall back to `alt` text.

---

## ✔ 6. Permission issues

Server may block access (403 error).

---

## ✔ 7. CORS blockage for external images

Image from another domain may fail due to CORS.

---

## ✔ 8. Mixed content issues (HTTPS vs HTTP)

HTTPS page cannot load HTTP image.

---

## ✔ 9. Hotlink protection

Some servers block external embedding.

---

### Example of a working image:

```html
<img src="/assets/images/profile.jpg" alt="User profile">
```

---

# ✔ Interview summary:

> Wrong path, missing file, CORS, HTTPS mismatch, unsupported format, or network errors are the main reasons images fail to load.

---

# ✅ **2. How will you structure HTML for a responsive layout?**

Responsive HTML focuses on **proper structure**, not CSS.

### Key techniques:

---

## ✔ 1. Use semantic structure

```html
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<main></main>
<footer></footer>
```

---

## ✔ 2. Use containers, sections, and groups

```html
<main>
  <section class="hero">
    <h1>Welcome</h1>
  </section>

  <section class="features">
    <article class="card">Feature 1</article>
    <article class="card">Feature 2</article>
  </section>
</main>
```

---

## ✔ 3. Use `<picture>` for responsive images

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="banner-large.jpg" media="(min-width: 800px)">
  <img src="banner-small.jpg" alt="Banner">
</picture>
```

---

## ✔ 4. Use meta viewport (mandatory)

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

---

## ✔ 5. Avoid fixed widths in HTML attributes

Instead of:

```html
<img width="600">
```

Use CSS later.

---

# ✔ Interview summary:

> Structure HTML using semantic sections, `<picture>`, flexible containers, and viewport meta for responsive behavior.

---

# ✅ **3. How do you make a website more accessible without changing CSS/JS?**

You can improve accessibility **purely with HTML**:

---

## ✔ 1. Add proper labels

```html
<label for="email">Email</label>
<input id="email" type="email">
```

---

## ✔ 2. Use semantic elements

```html
<nav></nav>
<main></main>
<article></article>
<footer></footer>
```

---

## ✔ 3. Add `alt` text to images

```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company logo">
```

---

## ✔ 4. Add ARIA attributes where needed

```html
<button aria-label="Open menu">
  <img src="menu.svg" alt="">
</button>
```

---

## ✔ 5. Maintain logical heading hierarchy

```html
<h1>Title</h1>
<h2>Section</h2>
```

---

## ✔ 6. Use `<table>` with proper structure

```html
<table>
  <thead>...</thead>
  <tbody>...</tbody>
</table>
```

---

## ✔ 7. Ensure focusable elements use `<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`

Don’t use `<div>` for clickable items.

---

# ✔ Interview summary:

> Accessibility improves with labels, alt texts, semantic tags, ARIA attributes, and proper heading hierarchy — all achievable using only HTML.

---

# ✅ **4. How do you embed third-party scripts without blocking the page?**

To prevent blocking the HTML parsing:

---

## ✔ 1. Use `async`

Script loads in parallel and executes immediately.

```html
<script src="https://example.com/ads.js" async></script>
```

Use case: analytics, ads.

---

## ✔ 2. Use `defer`

Script loads in parallel and executes after DOM is ready.

```html
<script src="https://example.com/chat.js" defer></script>
```

Use case: chat widgets or required scripts.

---

## ✔ 3. Lazy-load scripts using dynamic injection

```html
<script>
  const s = document.createElement('script');
  s.src = 'https://example.com/widget.js';
  document.body.appendChild(s);
</script>
```

---

## ✔ 4. Use `<iframe>` for heavy widgets

```html
<iframe src="promo.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
```

---

# ✔ Interview summary:

> Use async, defer, lazy loading, or dynamic loading to prevent third-party scripts from blocking page rendering.

---

# ✅ **5. Explain how browsers decide which HTML element gets focus.**

### Focus determines which element receives:

* keyboard input
* tab navigation
* screen-reader attention

---

### **Default focusable elements:**

* `<a href="">`
* `<button>`
* `<input>`
* `<textarea>`
* `<select>`
* `<iframe>`

---

## ✔ How browsers decide focus order?

### **1. Natural order (DOM order)**

Browser follows the sequence in HTML when pressing TAB.

Example:

```html
<input id="name">
<input id="email">
<button>Submit</button>
```

Focus order: name → email → button

---

### **2. Elements with `tabindex`**

```html
<div tabindex="0">Focusable div</div>
```

* `0` → follows natural DOM order
* `-1` → focusable only via JS
* `>0` → custom order (not recommended)

---

### **3. Disabled elements are skipped**

```html
<input disabled>
```

---

### **4. Hidden elements cannot receive focus**

* `display: none`
* `visibility: hidden`
* `hidden` attribute

---

### **5. `autofocus` attribute can set initial focus**

```html
<input type="text" autofocus>
```

---
”**.
