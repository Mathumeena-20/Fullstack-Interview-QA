Hint: Objects vs iterables.

### **8. What are pure functions? Why are they important?**

Hint: No side effects.

### **9. What is immutability? How do you achieve it in JS?**

Hint: Spread operator, Object.freeze.

Hint: Promise vs setTimeout.

### **13. What does `async/await` do internally?**

Hint: Built on top of Promises.

### **14. What is a Promise chain?**

Hint: `return` inside `.then()`.

### **15. What happens if you don’t handle Promise rejection?**

Hint: UnhandledRejection error.

### **16. How do you run promises in parallel?**

Hint: `Promise.all`, `Promise.allSettled`.

### **18. Explain destructuring with an example.**

Hint: Extract properties/values easily.

### **19. What is the spread operator used for?**

Hint: Copy, merge, expand arrays/objects.

### **20. Difference between `map`, `filter`, `reduce`.**

Hint: Transform, select, accumulate.

### **21. What is a generator function?**

Hint: `yield` pauses execution.

### **22. What is a Symbol? Why is it used?**

Hint: Unique object keys.

### **23. What are default parameters?**

Hint: Function parameter fallback.

# ✅ **4. Browser & Web API Concepts**

### **25. What is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies?**

Hint: Persistence + size + expiry.

### **26. What is CORS? Why does it happen?**

Hint: Security policy for cross-origin requests.

### **27. What is debounce vs throttle? Provide real use cases.**

Hint: Input search vs scroll events.

### **28. Why do we use `event.preventDefault()` and `event.stopPropagation()`?**

Hint: Prevent default action vs stop bubbling.

### **29. What are Web Workers?**

Hint: Background thread for heavy tasks.

### **30. What is the difference between synchronous & asynchronous code in JS?**

Hint: Blocking vs non-blocking.

---

# ✅ **5. OOP in JavaScript**

### **31. What is prototypal inheritance?**

Hint: Objects link to other objects.

### **32. How does `class` work in JavaScript internally?**

Hint: Syntactic sugar over prototypes.

### **33. What is the `this` keyword? How does it behave in different contexts?**

Hint: Depends on call-site, not definition.

### **34. How do arrow functions treat `this`?**

Hint: Lexical this.

### **35. Why can't arrow functions be used as constructors?**

Hint: No `[[Construct]]`.

---

# ✅ **6. Practical / Real Business-Style Problems**

### **36. Write a function to debounce API calls.**

(Used in search boxes)

### **37. Create a reusable `fetchWithRetry(url, retries)` method.**

(Used in real production APIs)

### **38. Flatten a nested array without using recursion (e.g., `[1,[2,[3]]]`).**

### **39. Remove duplicates from an array of objects.**

(Used in user lists, product catalogs)

### **40. Convert an array of objects into a lookup map.**

Use case: speed up search in e-commerce.

### **41. Deep clone an object without `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())`.**

Hint: Handle dates, functions, Map/Set.

### **42. Implement a custom event emitter.**

Use case: Real application messaging.

### **43. Find the longest substring without repeating characters.**

Classic interview algorithm.

### **44. Implement a polyfill for `Promise.all()`.**

### **45. Implement a polyfill for `Array.prototype.map()`.**

---

# ✅ **7. Advanced & Edge-Case Questions**
