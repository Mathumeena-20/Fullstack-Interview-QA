# ✅ 1. **How Would You Design a Scalable Python Application?**

### ✔️ What is Scalability?

Scalability means **the application can handle increasing loads (users, data, requests) efficiently** without major changes to its architecture.

---

## 🔹 Key Principles for Scalable Design:

### 1. **Modular Code Structure**

* Use **separation of concerns**: split code into modules, packages, and layers (like services, models, controllers).

### 2. **Stateless Services**

* Design APIs to be **stateless** so that they can scale horizontally (multiple servers can handle requests independently).

### 3. **Database Optimization**

* Use indexing, caching, and connection pooling.
* Avoid large joins and inefficient queries.

### 4. **Caching**

* Use **Redis** or **Memcached** to store frequently accessed data.
* Cache responses, static content, and database results.

### 5. **Asynchronous Processing**

* Use **asyncio, Celery, RabbitMQ** for background tasks to prevent blocking the main application.

### 6. **Load Balancing**

* Distribute requests across multiple servers using tools like **NGINX** or **HAProxy**.

### 7. **Queue Management**

* Offload time-consuming tasks to queues using **Celery** with a broker like **RabbitMQ** or **Redis.**

## 📌 Example Scalable Architecture (Django/Flask App)

```text
Client  ->  Load Balancer  ->  Web Server (Flask/Django)
                                 |
                          Async Task Queue (Celery + Redis)
                                 |
                             Database (Postgres)
                                 |
                              Cache (Redis)
```

---

### 📌 Example: Async Task with Celery

```python
# tasks.py
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def send_email(to, subject):
    print(f"Sending email to {to} with subject {subject}")
```

```python
# In your Flask/Django view
from tasks import send_email

def handle_request():
    send_email.delay('user@example.com', 'Welcome')
    return "Email is being sent in the background!"
```

✔️ This design prevents **slow tasks from blocking** the user’s response.

# ✅ 2. **How Do You Optimize Python Code for Performance?**

### 🔹 Key Techniques:

| Technique                    | Purpose                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Algorithm Optimization       | Reduce time complexity           |
| Data Structure Selection     | Use lists, sets, dicts smartly   |
| Built-in Functions           | Use optimized Python functions   |
| List Comprehensions          | Faster than for-loops            |
| Avoid Unnecessary Loops      | Eliminate redundant computations |
| Efficient File/DB Access     | Read/write efficiently           |
| Use Generators               | Lazy evaluation saves memory     |
| Use Caching                  | Avoid recomputation              |
| Use Multiprocessing or Async | Speed up I/O or CPU-heavy tasks  |

---

### 📌 Example 1: Use Generators (Memory Efficient)

```python
# Inefficient: List stores all numbers in memory
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1000000)]

# Efficient: Generator computes on the fly
squares = (x**2 for x in range(1000000))
```

---

### 📌 Example 2: List Comprehension vs. For Loop

```python
# Slow way
result = []
for i in range(1000):
    result.append(i * 2)

# Fast way
result = [i * 2 for i in range(1000)]
```

---

### 📌 Example 3: Use Built-in Functions

```python
# Inefficient
sum = 0
for i in range(1000000):
    sum += i

# Efficient
sum = sum(range(1000000))
```

---

### 📌 Example 4: Caching with functools.lru\_cache

```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

print(fib(50))  # Fast due to caching
```

---

### 📌 Example 5: Multiprocessing for Heavy CPU Tasks

```python
import multiprocessing

def square(n):
    return n * n

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
        results = pool.map(square, range(1000000))
    print("Done")
```

✔️ **`multiprocessing.Pool` parallelizes tasks across multiple CPU cores.**
